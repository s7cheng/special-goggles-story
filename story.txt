Nick is a 13-year-old boy, who lives with his parents and sister Beth. Recently, Nick wants new goggles for the lab of Chemistry class because he thinks his old ones are not cool.Nick checks Amazon and finds an Iron Man style goggles, which is aroud 35 dollars. Nick's mom thinks the googles are so expensive.
However, Nick has a strong desire to buy a new goggle, because he also wants to be a cool kid. In order to buy the goggle, he finds a job, catering service, at university. He needs to work 8 hours each week.  Eight hours is a lot of time to dedicate for one pair of goggles, especially with middle school drama. There's so much to deal with already-- girls, pre-algebra, and pesky chores!  However, new goggles might just make Nick the most coolest boy in the seventh grade. This certainly was a tough choice, so Nick made a powerpoint to present to his mother for why she should buy them.
